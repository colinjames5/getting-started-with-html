    <h1> Important Concepts </h1>
    <div>
      <h2> Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML </h2>

      <div>
        <h3> The Basics of the Web </h3>
        <p>
        The basic units of the web are as follows: <br>
        <ol>
            <li> the web </li>
            <li> HTML </li>
            <li> URLs </li>
           <li> HTTP </li>
           <li> Web Applications </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3> World Wide Web </h3>
        <p>
         HTML stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language </em>, and is the basis for everything on the web.
       </p>

        <h3> Major Pieces </h3>
        <p>
          The major pieces of the web are as follows: <br>
          <ol>
            <li> YOU! </li>
            <li> Your computer + a browser </li>
            <li> the Internet </li>
           <li> Servers </li>
          </ol>
         <br>
          A <em> browser </em> is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. <br>
         The <em> Internet </em> is the world's larget computer network. <br>
         <em> Servers </em> are computers that are optimized for hosting files on the web.
       </p>
     </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3> HTML </h3>
        <p>
         HTML is made up of: <br>
         <ol>
          <li> text content (what you see) </li>
          <li> markup (what it looks like) </li>
          <li> references to other documents (e.g. images and videos) </li>
          <li> links to other pages </li>
         </ol>
       </p>
     </div>
  
      <div>
       <h3> Tags and Elements </h3>
       <p>
        <em> Elements </em> make up HTML documents. An element contains an opening tag, followed by content, and ending with a closing tag. <br> 
          <em> Tags </em> tell the browser what type of element is being used. <br>
          For example, <b> bold tags </b> make the content bold, while <em> emphasis tags </em> make the content italicized. <br>
        </p>
      </div>
     
      <div>
        <h3> Inline vs Block Elements </h3>
       <p>
          HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> or <b> block </b>. <em> Block </em> elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. The box height and width can be changed.
       </p>
     </div>
   </div>

     <h2> Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML </h2>

      <div>
       <h3> Developer Tools (in the Browser) </h3>
       <p>
          HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> or <b> block </b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
       </p>
     </div>

     <div>
        <h3> The "tree-like structure" of HTML </h3>
       <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... <br>
       In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h3> The relationship between indented HTML and boxes </h3>
        <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em> text </em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h3> Text Editors (for programming) </h3>
       <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tage when you write an opeing tag.
