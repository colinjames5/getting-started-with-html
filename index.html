<h1> Unit 1 </h1>

<b> The Basics of the Web </b>
<p>
  The basic units of the web are as follows: <br>
  1. the web <br>
  2. HTML <br>
  3. URLs <br>
  4. HTTP <br>
  5. Web Applications <br>
</p>
  
<b> World Wide Web </b>
<p>
  HTML stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language </em>, and is the basis for everything on the web.
</p>
  
<b> Major Pieces </b>
<p>
  The major pieces of the web are as follows: <br>
  <b> 1. </b> YOU! <br>
  <b> 2. </b> Your computer + a browser <br>
  <b> 3. </b> the Internet <br>
  <b> 4. </b> Servers <br>
  <br>
  A <em> browser </em> is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. <br>
  The <em> Internet </em> is the world's larget computer network. <br>
  <em> Servers </em> are computers that are optimized for hosting files on the web.
</p>
  
<b> HTML </b>
<p>
  HTML is made up of: <br>
  <b> 1. </b> text content (what you see) <br>
  <b> 2. </b> markup (what it looks like) <br>
  <b> 3. </b> references to other documents (e.g. images and videos) <br>
  <b> 4. </b> links to other pages <br>
</p>
  
<b> Tags and Elements </b>
<p>
  <em> Elements </em> make up HTML documents. An element contains an opening tag, followed by content, and ending with a closing tag. <br> 
  <em> Tags </em> tell the browser what type of element is being used. <br>
  For example, <b> bold tags </b> make the content bold, while <em> emphasis tags </em> make the content italicized. <br>
</p>
     
<b> Inline vs Block Elements </b>
<p>
  HTML elements are either inline or block. <em> Block </em> elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. The box height and width can be changed.
